"""
    List, Set, Dict Comprehensions:

        - Shorter and more readable way to create collections
        - Syntax:   [expression for item in iterable if condition]
                    {expression for item in iterable if condition}
                    {key: value for key, value in iterable}

    Advantages:
        - More concise than for-loops
        - Can include conditions
        - Works with list, set, and dict
