"""
    generators:
        - Special functions that return an iterator
        - They can pause execution and resume later
        - They are defined using the 'yield' keyword

    Notes:
        - Generators donâ€™t store all values in memory at once.
        - Much more memory efficient than lists for large sequences.
        - lazy evaluation (generate data only when needed)
        - Base for async/await and co-routines in Python.
